Hi! this is an example of the classic Snake Game. The base of this project was made following a tutorial for the tkinter Python pacakage, but has a couple gameplay enhancements.

This project was mostly done for fun and was a good introduction to making Python projects with a canvas and GUI.

Have fun!
